What is this man !!!!!!
Hey man, welcome to this nice linux mandrake system.... is easy to use, easy to install, and have a nice ide but i want to get a new one...
This directory is intended to be the root for examples dowografy from stevens, and other unix erudits.  What you have to do to run most of the examples is to compile each of them with :
gcc file.o libmisc.a -o file.out

and then, of course, run file.out....
....that's all folks ....!!!
